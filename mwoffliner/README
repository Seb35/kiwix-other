mwoffliner is a tool which allows to "dump" a Wikimedia project
(Wikipedia, Wiktionary, ...) to a local storage. It goes through all
articles of the project and write the HTML/pictures  to local files.

To use it, you need a recent version of nodejs and a POSIX system
(like GNU/Linux). You need also to install all necessary nodejs
packages with "npm install <modulename>" in this directory. You can
get the list of packages you need to install in the "MODULE VARIABLE
SECTION".

You need also a redis server correctly configured and listening to
/tmp/redis.sock.

One time you have done this, you should be able to start the tool with
./mwoffliner. To configure things related to the project you want to
dump, just go to the "CUSTOM VARIABLE SECTION".
