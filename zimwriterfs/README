zimwriterfs is a console tool to create ZIM (http://www.openzim.org)
files from a localy stored directory containing a "self-sufficient"
HTML content (with pictures, javascript, stylesheets). The result will
contain all the files of the local directory compress and merge in the
ZIM file. Nothing more, nothing less. The generated file can be open
with a ZIM reader, Kiwix (http://www.kiwix.org) for example.

zimwriterfs works for now only on POSIX compatible systems, you simply
need to compile it and run it. The software does not need a lot of
resources, but if you create a pretty big ZIM files, then it could
take a wile to complete.

To compile zimwriterfs, you need the GNU compiler with the GNU
autotools suite. You also need to have a few dependencies installes on
the system:

* liblzma (http://tukaani.org/xz/), resp. for the LZMA comp.
* libzim (http://openzim.org/download/), resp. for the ZIM compilation
* libmagic (http://www.darwinsys.com/file/), resp, for the mimeType
  detection
