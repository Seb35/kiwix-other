zimwriterfs is a console tool to create ZIM (http://www.openzim.org)
files from a localy stored directory containing a "self-sufficient"
HTML content (with pictures, javascript, stylesheets). The result will
contain all the files of the local directory compressed and merged in
the ZIM file. Nothing more, nothing less. The generated file can be
open with a ZIM reader, Kiwix (http://www.kiwix.org) for example, but
you have other one (http://openzim.org/wiki/ZIM_Readers).

zimwriterfs works for now only on POSIX compatible systems, you simply
need to compile it and run it. The software does not need a lot of
resources, but if you create a pretty big ZIM files, then it could
take a wile to complete.

GNU/Linux compilation
---------------------

To compile zimwriterfs, you need the GNU compiler with the GNU
autotools suite. You also need to have a few dependencies installed on
the system:

* liblzma (http://tukaani.org/xz/, most of the time packaged),
  resp. for the LZMA comp.
* libzim (http://openzim.org/download/, probably not packaged),
  resp. for the ZIM compilation
* libmagic (http://www.darwinsys.com/file/, most of the time
  packaged), resp, for the mimeType detection

OSX compilation
----------------

Until the autotool is configured properly to support flexible options,
you can still compile and use zimwriterfs with some manual work.

1. Have a working Kiwix dev environnment (up to make inside src/dependencies)
2. Install libmagic: brew install libmagic
3. zimwriterfs compilation
./autogen.sh
LDFLAGS="-L$KIWIX_ROOT/src/dependencies/zimlib-1.1/build/lib/ -L/usr/local/Cellar/libmagic/5.14/lib/ -L$KIWIX_ROOT/src/dependencies/xz/build/lib/" CXXFLAGS="-I $KIWIX_ROOT/src/kiwix/src/dependencies/zimlib-1.1/include/ -I/usr/local/Cellar/libmagic/5.14/include/ -I$KIWIX_ROOT/src/kiwix/src/dependencies/xz/src/liblzma/lzma/ -I$KIWIX_ROOT/src/kiwix/src/dependencies/xz/src/liblzma/" ./configure && make
4. Copy libs if not in LIBRARY_PATH
ln -s $KIWIX_ROOT/src/dependencies/zimlib-1.1/build/lib/libzim.dylib .
ln -s $KIWIX_ROOT/src/dependencies/xz/build/lib/liblzma.dylib .
5. Use it
./zimwriterfs
